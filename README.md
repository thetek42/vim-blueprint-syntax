# vim-blueprint-syntax

A Vim plugin that provides syntax highlighting for GTK Blueprint files.

**Note:** This plugin is not complete whatsoever. It lacks some of the syntax that Blueprint provides as well as some other useful stuff (auto indents etc). Feel free to open an issue or a pull request about possible changes or improvements to the plugin. This was also the first Vim syntax highlighting plugin that I created, so there might be a couple of bugs and rough edges with it.
